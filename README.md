# Climate Change Explorer

## Installation

Requires Node 14+ (likely runs on older versions too)

npm install
npm run build
npm start

If the client build fails, you may need to create a .env in the client directory with the following entry:

``` ./client/.env
SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true
```

Open [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in your browser to view the application
